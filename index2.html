            <h3> Composition </h3>
                <p> 
                    During today’s lecture we learned about composition. This included looking at grids and the layout of webpages, visual hierarchy, colour and typography, scale, 
                    white space, and balance. I now understand the importance of grids, as they provide a useful means when thinking about page components and how it flows. I need to 
                    consider this when it comes to designing my website and placing elements onto the page to ensure the flow of content makes sense. Visual hierarchy is also an extremely 
                    important part of web design as it can help grab users' attention and guide them through the website in an appropriate/intended order. I learned how visual hierarchy 
                    can be achieved through a variety of elements. This includes how the size and weight of text and contrast of colour can grab attention by making elements appear more 
                    popped out. After learning about colour and typography in a previous lecture, this has made me feel more confident in applying it to my design. Scale is also important 
                    for visual hierarchy, as it determines the order of importance of elements on a page. White space allows elements to ‘breathe’ on a page, and can draw user’s eyes towards 
                    imagery, text, call-to-actions, and certain colour, which is something I will utilise in my designs. When creating designs for my website I will consider how I use hierarchy 
                    and the elements listed above in order to apply composition, which will help create an effective website and easy navigation for the user. Because my website is targeted to 
                    people who are anxious/unorganised, I want to ensure I properly apply these elements/principles to ensure my website provides a simple and calming experience.

            <h3> Affordance </h3>
                <p> 
                    This lecture also went over affordance. I was introduced to the mental model, which allowed me to understand how people may construct these based on past interactions and 
                    beliefs. This means people can construct different mental models of the same user interface, which is an important point, yet something I have never thought about before. 
                    Mental models of website structures are formed so a user has expectations when navigating through a page. Affordances show how users interact with certain elements on a website, 
                    such as buttons, links, input fields, and icons. Affordances can provide useful cues and psychological shortcuts for a user, which is important to consider. Call-to-actions 
                    are a crucial element of a website and are often displayed using buttons that redirect a user. The affordance is when the button isclicked, it will lead the user to the relevant 
                    page. Colours, shapes, and text of a button are helpful indicators of affordance and establish the importance of it and provide clear communication for a user, which is important 
                    so they clearly understand the website. This is important for my design as its crucial users avoid confusion and frustration. I am certain I will have affordances such as buttons 
                    and links on my website, so it is important I carefully consider the layout as well as the different elements such as button colour and size. This will ensure affordance can be 
                    applied in order to benefit the design and create a positive user experience.

            <h3> Assignment 2.2 Options </h3>
                <p> 
                    This week we were given a brief introduction to assignment 2.2. This included being given the option to code the website or use CMS, and what our option means for the next 
                    project. I have coded a website before for a previous course assignment (INFO101) but it was an extremely basic website and a time-consuming process. Because I know I don’t 
                    have the skills to be able to code a website that looks and functions like my Figma prototype, I have decided to use CMS. I tried out both EditorX and Webflow, and have decided 
                    to use EditorX to create my website. Using CMS will ensure I am able to produce a final outcome that I know I will be happy with, and will reflect, or even be improved, from 
                    the Figma prototype.  
                </p>

            <h3> Assignment 2.1 Presentation </h3>
                <p> 
                    I was unfortunately unable to make this lecture as I had an appointment that clashed. Because of this, I had to email in a recorded version of the presentation, and was
                    unable to see the rest of the classes presentations or receive feedback on my designs. During this 3 minute presentation I went through the different stages of assignment 2.1 
                    (style guide, wireframes, iterations) and then presented my final prototype. I walked through the elements and functions of how I expect this website to work, so users would 
                    gain an understanding of the purpose and how the website works. Being able to present and go through my designs allowed me to reflect on my process, and get me thinking about 
                    the next stages of the project.

            <h3> Coding: CSS Grids Part 2 </h3>
                 <p> 
                    This lecture has built on the content learned in CSS grids part 1. This time, it showed how to ensure a responsive design, from a mobile-sized screen to a desktop side. 
                    Responsiveness when it comes to device sizes is really important, as you want to ensure the website works across all devices to provide convenience for the user. Although 
                    this lecture was pretty easy to follow, when it came to applying it to my own blog code and content I struggled to get it to work. This is because I had multiple sections 
                    and headings on a page, so when it came to adjusting it in CSS it would not work the way I wanted it to. As much as I would have liked to use this for my code, I had to play 
                    around and find alternatives to ensure it worked. This has meant that my blog is not responsive to all screen sizes. In the future, I want to gain further understanding and 
                    practice to utilise this.

            <h3> Responsive Design </h3>
                <p> 
                    Today’s lecture went through a brief introduction to responsive design, and the importance of a website being able to work seamlessly across a variety of devices. There 
                    are so many different ways to access the web, which has resulted in different ratios. A website should work for a user, regardless of their device. The requirement for this 
                    assignment is to ensure our websites are responsive for laptop and desktop screens, with a minimum of 1024px wide. We were taught different ways to test the website, such as 
                    through device emulation, cross-browser testing, and usability testing, which I will be implementing to ensure the website is compatible across different-sized laptop and desktop 
                    screens. I understand the frustration of a website being great to use on a laptop, but is poorly designed for mobile use.
