                <h2> Week Two: 18/07/2023</h2>
    
                <h3> Personas</h3>
                    <p> During this class we were given a deeper insight into what would be required for assignment one, specifically for creating personas. I 
                        understood that as a designer, it is important to fully understand the  user and their needs/motivations in order to help them achieve their 
                        goals. This will also help a designer simultaneously achieve their own goals. Personas can be applied in web design to enhance user experience, 
                        accessibility, user journeys, and much more. To enhance our understanding, we completed a workshop that involved working as a group to create and 
                        structure a persona. We were introduced to the website ‘cards for humanity’ which we utilised for inspiration and to help us get started.
                        This practice was beneficial for me as a designer as it worked to help reinforce my understanding, and has given me confidence for creating 
                        a persona on my own.

                <h3> The History of Web Design (1990-1998)</h3>
                    <p> I found this section really interesting as my knowledge about the history of web design was extremely limited. I believe it is important as a designer 
                        to be well-informed about the history of web design, especially since I will be designing a website in this course. We were given a breakdown of significant
                        events that happened in certain years, such as the birth of the World Wide Web in 1990 and the creation of GeoCities in 1994. Being able to access and explore 
                        these websites, as well as seeing how they developed over the years with the introduction of CSS, really fascinated me. I noticed the layouts of the earlier 
                        websites were minimalistic and basic, which I believe is still important in web design today in terms of usability, accessibility, and navigation. As a designer, 
                        it inspired me to appreciate the progress and development of web design, as well as principles such as simplicity. This has influenced me to consider these when 
                        it comes to designing my website.

                <h3> Coding: Introduction to HTML Basics</h3>
                    <p> The prerecorded coding lecture gave a basic introduction to coding in HTML. This involved setting up the code and learning about the different headings, 
                        inserting paragraphs, and images. I have recently completed a course (INFO101) that went through the basics of coding a website using HTML and CSS, so I was 
                        familiar with the content being introduced and have reasonable experience using Visual Studio Code for coding. Despite this, I found it quite helpful as a refresher 
                        as it has been some time since I last used it. Knowing the basics of HTML is critical in web design as it is the foundation for web pages.
