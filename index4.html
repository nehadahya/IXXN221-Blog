                <h3> The History of Web Design (2009-Present) </h3>
                    <p> In todayâ€™s lecture we wrapped up the final part of the history of web design, looking at the years 2009 up until the present. Again, it has been interesting
                        to see how websites and interactions have evolved since the creation of the World Wide Web. Throughout this session we were introduced to websites that would 
                        be helpful throughout this course, such as Figma for developing website designs and Google Fonts to use in coding. In terms of web design, these are resources 
                        that can be used to customise and improve a website, and to help plan and design for optimisation. Being able to see the development of websites up until the 
                        present day has inspired me, and has me wanting to incorporate and use some of the principles/resources discovered.

                <h3> Customer Journey Maps and User Flow</h3>
                    <p> This week we were introduced to customer journey maps and user flows. The purpose of the customer journey map is to show the stages, feelings, and experiences 
                        the customer will go through before, during, and after interacting with the website. It is important to understand how the user may interact with the website in 
                        order to further improve the user experience and ensure it fits their requirements. The user flow shows the actions/interactions a user takes when interacting with 
                        the website in order to achieve their goals. These can be split into 3 categories; displays, decisions, and actions. This is important for web design as it shows how 
                        the user will be interacting with the product and any improvements that need to be made. My knowledge will allow me to apply this to project 1, and be able to dive deeper 
                        and explore the different stages the user will undertake when interacting with my website. (Assignment 1 user flow and customer journey map pictured)

                <h3> CSS Box Model</h3>
                    <p> This week we were introduced to CSS, which allows HTML elements to be customised. This includes changing background colours, the size and colour of fonts, as well as 
                        the height spacing between words, in order to make a website more visually pleasing and easy to navigate/read (if done correctly). It also allows you to add padding, 
                        borders, and margins. This will be important when it comes to styling and designing the website/blog during the coding stage, to ensure elements line up and work together. 
                        Adding colour will help create personality, and being able to adjust the size of images and text will help with visual hierarchy, which is important in web design. 
                    </p>
