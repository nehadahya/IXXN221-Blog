                <h3> Composition </h3>
                    <p> During today’s lecture we learned about composition. This included looking at grids and the layout of webpages, visual hierarchy, colour and typography, scale, 
                        white space, and balance. I now understand the importance of grids, as they provide a useful means when thinking about page components and how it flows. I need to 
                        consider this when it comes to designing my website and placing elements onto the page to ensure the flow of content makes sense. Visual hierarchy is also an extremely 
                        important part of web design as it can help grab users' attention and guide them through the website in an appropriate/intended order. I learned how visual hierarchy 
                        can be achieved through a variety of elements. This includes how the size and weight of text and contrast of colour can grab attention by making elements appear more 
                        popped out. After learning about colour and typography in a previous lecture, this has made me feel more confident in applying it to my design. Scale is also important 
                        for visual hierarchy, as it determines the order of importance of elements on a page. White space allows elements to ‘breathe’ on a page, and can draw user’s eyes towards 
                        imagery, text, call-to-actions, and certain colour, which is something I will utilise in my designs. When creating designs for my website I will consider how I use hierarchy 
                        and the elements listed above in order to apply composition, which will help create an effective website and easy navigation for the user. Because my website is targeted to 
                        people who are anxious/unorganised, I want to ensure I properly apply these elements/principles to ensure my website provides a simple and calming experience.

                <h3> Affordance </h3>
                    <p> This lecture also went over affordance. I was introduced to the mental model, which allowed me to understand how people may construct these based on past interactions and 
                        beliefs. This means people can construct different mental models of the same user interface, which is an important point, yet something I have never thought about before. 
                        Mental models of website structures are formed so a user has expectations when navigating through a page. Affordances show how users interact with certain elements on a website, 
                        such as buttons, links, input fields, and icons. Affordances can provide useful cues and psychological shortcuts for a user, which is important to consider. Call-to-actions 
                        are a crucial element of a website and are often displayed using buttons that redirect a user. The affordance is when the button isclicked, it will lead the user to the relevant 
                        page. Colours, shapes, and text of a button are helpful indicators of affordance and establish the importance of it and provide clear communication for a user, which is important 
                        so they clearly understand the website. This is important for my design as its crucial users avoid confusion and frustration. I am certain I will have affordances such as buttons 
                        and links on my website, so it is important I carefully consider the layout as well as the different elements such as button colour and size. This will ensure affordance can be 
                        applied in order to benefit the design and create a positive user experience.
