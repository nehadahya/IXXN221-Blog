                <h3> Introduction to IXXN221</h3>
                    <P> 
                        Today’s class was an introduction to the IXXN221 course. I learned about how it has changed over the years (switched from a coding-focused course to a design-focused one), 
                        and looked at previous assignments to understand what is expected. I initially did have concerns about the course being entirely online, but after this lecture, I feel more 
                        certain and comfortable about the structure and support I will be able to receive throughout. I believe that the course introduction and seeing previous students’ work has 
                        motivated and inspired me to do my best throughout this course. This is important for me as a designer, as I should clearly understand the task and be able to carry it out at 
                        the highest standard I can achieve.

                        We also made name cards to share with the class. We did these on Figma, which is something I have never used before. This activity was a great opportunity to quickly experiment and 
                        trial with Figma in order to become more comfortable using it for future assignments. There was a reasonable amount of customisability which made making the name tags fun!
