                <h2> Week Eight: 12/09/2023</h2>
                <h3> Assignment 2.2 Options </h3>
                    <p> This week we were given a brief introduction to assignment 2.2. This included being given the option to code the website or use CMS, and what our option means for the next 
                        project. I have coded a website before for a previous course assignment (INFO101) but it was an extremely basic website and a time-consuming process. Because I know I donâ€™t 
                        have the skills to be able to code a website that looks and functions like my Figma prototype, I have decided to use CMS. I tried out both EditorX and Webflow, and have decided 
                        to use EditorX to create my website. Using CMS will ensure I am able to produce a final outcome that I know I will be happy with, and will reflect, or even be improved, from 
                        the Figma prototype.  
                    </p>

                <h3> Assignment 2.1 Presentation </h3>
                    <p> I was unfortunately unable to make this lecture as I had an appointment that clashed. Because of this, I had to email in a recorded version of the presentation, and was
                        unable to see the rest of the classes presentations or receive feedback on my designs. During this 3 minute presentation I went through the different stages of assignment 2.1 
                        (style guide, wireframes, iterations) and then presented my final prototype. I walked through the elements and functions of how I expect this website to work, so users would 
                        gain an understanding of the purpose and how the website works. Being able to present and go through my designs allowed me to reflect on my process, and get me thinking about 
                        the next stages of the project.
                    </p>

                <h3> Coding: CSS Grids Part 2</h3>
                    <p> This lecture has built on the content learned in CSS grids part 1. This time, it showed how to ensure a responsive design, from a mobile-sized screen to a desktop side. 
                        Responsiveness when it comes to device sizes is really important, as you want to ensure the website works across all devices to provide convenience for the user. Although 
                        this lecture was pretty easy to follow, when it came to applying it to my own blog code and content I struggled to get it to work. This is because I had multiple sections 
                        and headings on a page, so when it came to adjusting it in CSS it would not work the way I wanted it to. As much as I would have liked to use this for my code, I had to play 
                        around and find alternatives to ensure it worked. This has meant that my blog is not responsive to all screen sizes. In the future, I want to gain further understanding and 
                        practice to utilise this.
