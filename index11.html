                <h3> Assignment 2.2 Presentation </h3>
                    <p> Today we presented our final 2.2 assignments after handing it in. This included walking through the completed website and explaining our experiences or any changes made from 
                        the Figma final design. My feedback was reasonably brief but was valuable and insightful as it was something I did not necessarily consider. My main feedback was based on the 
                        heart icons, as when they were clicked they turned from white to purple. The idea of affordance came up where one of the tutors mentioned they expected the heart to turn from 
                        white to red, based on previous experiences and interactions with these buttons on other websites. It was also mentioned that the base of the white hard was hard to see in some 
                        images, so a black outline could be applied to ensure the users can see the button. The use of interactions, hover effects, and other animations were something I was happy with, 
                        and was recognised in my feedback as well. These pieces of advice were helpful and will definitely be considered when it comes to future projects.

                <h3> Coding Reflection</h3>
                    <p> I found that all the coding lectures were easy to follow which was important to reinforce my understanding. The first few lectures were refreshers as I had learned about 
                        it in a previous course, but as they went on they got more complex. I did struggle when it came to CSS grids, specifically when having multiple ‘main’ sections in one page, 
                        so I am worried that I am going to run into this struggle when it comes to coding my blog. There are solutions, such as creating a separate page per entry, but I would expect 
                        that to be a rather time-consuming process.
