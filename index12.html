                <h3> Workshop and Course Reflection </h3>
                    <p> In todayâ€™s workshop, we redesigned a website in order to improve it based on what we had learned throughout this course. Elements we fixed included spelling, colours, text, 
                        and spacing to ensure a consistent, cohesive design. I had fun during this workshop and believe it was a nice way to wrap up the course!

                        <br> <br> 

                        Overall, I really enjoyed this course. Coming into it I did not know what to expect, especially since the course was all online, but I have learned some valuable skills 
                        which I will continue to use outside of this course. I believe going through the whole process, from creating personas, venn diagrams, and user flows/journey maps, to designing 
                        prototypes, to creating the website was good practice to get an idea of the flow. Throughout this course, I used softwares I had never used before, such as Figma, EditorX, and GitHub. 
                        I learned that these are used frequently in web design, therefore it was valuable being introduced to them now.
