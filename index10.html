                <h3> Blog Demo </h3>
                    <p> During today’s lecture we were given a blog demo by Shiv and Jamie, where they walked us through the blogs they coded. I had been thinking about how to structure my blog 
                        but wasn’t sure where to start, so being able to see previous examples was inspiring. Advice they gave included using fractions/percentages instead of pixels to ensure it is 
                        responsive to all page sizes, as well as keeping the page simple. Another suggestion was to create a template that can be copied and applied throughout the blog, to ensure 
                        consistency and make it easier to code. These pieces of advice were helpful to me and I will definitely keep these in mind when I start coding.  
                    </p>

                <h3> Assignment 2.2 Reflection</h3>
                    <p> I have had a few issues when creating my website on EditorX. I managed to get it looking exactly how I wanted it to on my laptop’s screen size, but as soon as I tested it on 
                        my monitor the layout changed. Text/headings were overlapping images, and spacing between each item was different. In order to fix this I had to set the elements to fixed, 
                        which meant they stay the same size despite the screen size. This was ideally not what I wanted, but all I could achieve with my skillset and knowledge. I also had struggles 
                        with other elements such as the like button, which did cause a bit of frustration. Despite this, I believe this was a good experience to learn about EditorX. With a bit more 
                        knowledge and research, I believe I would be able to create effective websites on this platform.
