                <h2> Week Nine: 19/09/2023</h2>
                <h3> Responsive Design </h3>
                    <p> Todayâ€™s lecture went through a brief introduction to responsive design, and the importance of a website being able to work seamlessly across a variety of devices. There 
                        are so many different ways to access the web, which has resulted in different ratios. A website should work for a user, regardless of their device. The requirement for this 
                        assignment is to ensure our websites are responsive for laptop and desktop screens, with a minimum of 1024px wide. We were taught different ways to test the website, such as 
                        through device emulation, cross-browser testing, and usability testing, which I will be implementing to ensure the website is compatible across different-sized laptop and desktop 
                        screens. I understand the frustration of a website being great to use on a laptop, but is poorly designed for mobile use. 
                    </p>

                <h3> File Organisation </h3>
                    <p> This week we were also taught about the importance of labeling and organising files. This is important as organised files helps with collaborations, productivity, teamwork,
                        and maintenance which are vital in order to succeed in a task. Ways to do this include naming conventions, asset management (having separate folders for icons, images, and 
                        fonts), as well as documenting project progress so people understand changes and can look back on decision-making. My website has quite a few images and icons, therefore it is 
                        important I label and organise these clearly to ensure I can find them easily and I am not wasting time sorting through hundreds of files.
