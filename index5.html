                <h3> Project Feedback </h3>
                    <p> Todayâ€™s lecture was used to review the expected structure of assignment 1, which is due next week. This was also the last opportunity for project support. We were 
                        split into breakout rooms in order to receive feedback. At this stage, I had only partially completed my persona and venn diagram, so I found this was a good time 
                        to get feedback before moving onto the user flow and journey map. From the persona and venn diagram, I had the idea of a planning website that would allow a user to 
                        organise their tasks and activities. I liked this idea, but I was struggling to picture how to create the user journey map and flow diagrams as I was unsure on how I 
                        would execute this type of website when it came to actually designing it. Therefore, getting feedback was helpful as I was given a suggestion to make my website one that 
                        provides guides and resources to tackle planning, rather than being an actual planner website. This would make the projects achievable, and help me when creating my user 
                        flow and journey map.

                <h3> Coding: CSS Grids Part 1</h3>
                    <p> This prerecorded lecture went over divs and flexboxes. I have had experience with using divs and flexboxes before, but I never fully understood how they worked. This 
                        lecture helped me understand how divs can allow text, images, and other elements can be arranged and allows for structure in a website. Flexboxes can change how elements 
                        are displayed on a page, such as spacing, aligning, and ordering. There are many different options when it comes to flexboxes, which will be beneficial when it comes to 
                        coding my website/blog. So far with coding, I have been feeling somewhat confident. Because I have prior knowledge of the basics, it is making it slightly easier to understand.
