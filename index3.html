                <h2> Week Three: 25/07/2023</h2>
                <h3> Design Goals (Venn Diagram) </h3>
                    <p> In this lecture we were taught about quantitative and qualitative goals, as well as the SMART goal framework. I was also made aware of how some of the goals 
                        between a user and a designer can overlap, and how Venn Diagrams are used to best visualise this. This is important for web design as it allows for shared 
                        understanding between a user and the designer, a user-centred design, and improved user experience. Goals should be considered in web design as it is useless 
                        to create a website that is the opposite of what the user needs. In today’s workshop we used a persona created from last weeks workshop to come up with goals 
                        for both the user and designer, as well as some goals they may share. Feedback we received included diving deeper into what we meant by certain words such as 
                        ‘easy’ and ‘straightforward’, as well as thinking about what would make our proposed website idea different to others. As a designer, getting feedback is important, 
                        and I will consider this when it comes to assignment.
                    </p>

                <h3> The History of Web Design (1998-2008)</h3>
                    <p>  During this lecture I learned about the history of web design from 1998-2008, which built on content from last week’s lecture. Similar to last week’s entry, I 
                        found this section interesting as my knowledge of web design is pretty small. Seeing the development from lists of words and limited colour in the 1990’s, to 
                        websites with a wide range of customisation as the years went by was inspiring to see. The idea of skeuomorphism was something I hadn’t taken too much notice of 
                        before, but it really fascinated me. Learning more about the history of web design and seeing the events and pages of websites influenced me as a designer, as 
                        some of these principles, like simplicity, should continue to be applied in web design. 
                    </p>

                        <br> <br> 

                <h3> Coding: Introduction to HTML Basics Part 2</h3>
                    <p> This prerecorded coding lecture went over using anchor tags to hyperlink pages through texts and images, as well as using lists, both ordered and unordered. 
                        This is built on the knowledge from last week’s lecture. Again, I had prior knowledge of the anchor tags but it was interesting to learn about the ordered and 
                        unordered lists and how the unordered has bullet points, while the ordered has numbers to show importance or a specific order of the content. Learning the basics 
                        of HTML is crucial for web design, so I will be sure to consider implementing this code in my projects. 
                    </p>
