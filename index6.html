                <h2> Week Six: 15/08/2023</h2>
                <h3> Colour </h3>
                    <p> During this lecture we were given an introduction to colours. I learned more about the different types (RGB, CMYK, pantone), as well as the different types of colour 
                        schemes (analogous, complementary etc). I was introduced to different websites that can help build colour schemes, as well as the different meanings of colours. This is 
                        important for web design as if I am creating a website that is meant to be helping with reducing stress, I want to be incorporating colours that represent and resemble this 
                        (such as blue, white etc). I was also introduced to accessibility websites that test the colour scheme to ensure eligibility and inclusivity, as well as rules such as the 
                        60-30-10 rule. This made me understand the importance of colour in a website and is something I need to heavily consider throughout the website design process.

                <h3> Typography</h3>
                    <p> This lecture also covered typography, which I found informative as I donâ€™t have much experience or knowledge on this topic. It gave an introduction to the different types 
                        of typeface (serif, sans serif) as well as their identities, such as whether they are used for a classic or dramatic purpose. Google fonts was reintroduced, which would 
                        be a helpful resource as these fonts can be applied and used in code. I learned about the different types of font sizes and the specificity and importance of scaling text. 
                        I never realised there were specific resources and ways that provide a guide of what size each heading should be, to ensure visual hierarchy and consistency. Leading and 
                        paragraph width were also something I have never really considered, and will be important when it comes to web design, as it will ensure text is easy to read and understand,
                        creating a positive user experience. The workshop included critiquing a website design, which allowed us to use our knowledge of colour and typography to analyse a website 
                        and look for inconsistencies and improvements.

                <h3> Coding: Basics to GitHub</h3>
                    <p> Before this lecture, I had never heard of GitHub. My understanding is that GitHub desktop allows for interaction with GitHub. It can neatly list out projects and also allows 
                        for collaboration. It lets a user to keep track of their files and see any updates made to track progress, and can hold work, even if it is removed from a computer. If a mistake 
                        is made, it can be changed back to a previous version which will be a beneficial feature when it comes to trialling different things with code. I did attempt to download Github 
                        desktop and set it up, and although I did struggle at the beginning, I believe I will gain more knowledge and become more confident as I use it more. This introduction was a helpful 
                        guide to refer back to when it comes to the coding part of this course.
